## How to Use

Use the add button to start adding gates. When done, you can save them using the save as template option in the save menu (Just type the name of your choice and your done!). 

<b><u>Note</u></b>: Unfortunately, for the moment, you are not able to load saved gates from the game itself. I am working on it and I assure you that it will soon be possible.

## Upcomming Features

I would really like to add a way for the user to create, save and use their own gates. I am working on it (You can see it from the save as obj option).
